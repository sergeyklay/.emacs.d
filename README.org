* Serghei's GNU Emacs Configuration

This repository contains my personal configuration for GNU Emacs that I use on
the daily and port around from system to system with me.  This is the second
repository I clone — after [[https://github.com/sergeyklay/dotfiles][my dotfiles]] — when settling in on a new system.

** The Philosophy

The guiding philosophy behind this Emacs configuration is that it
should be a direct extension of my own memory.  This project serves as
a representation of what I can actively recall and understand.

As a result, you won't find overly complex settings or sophisticated
designs here.  The aim is to keep everything as straightforward and
transparent as possible.  This ensures that the configuration can be
easily read, understood, and held mentally.

If you come across this project, bear in mind that it's molded to fit
what I can keep "in my head" rather than what Emacs is capable of
doing.  The simplicity is intentional and serves as a mnemonic aid for
me.

This Emacs configuration is designed around four core principles that
aim to make it an efficient, transparent, and portable extension of my
workflow:

- self-contained :: A duo of =early-init.el= and =init.el= files
  responsible for loading and configuring publicly available packages,
  with the exception of ~custom.el~.
- small :: The configuration files collectively stay under 512 lines
  in total.
- built-in packages :: Preference is given to built-in solutions; if
  unavailable, GNU alternatives take precedence over MELPA packages.
- system-agnostic :: The setup should function seamlessly across
  different operating systems.

While the focus is on a streamlined Emacs setup, it's crucial to have
some form of documentation for better clarity and maintenance. Unlike
other Emacs users who opt for literate programming, my approach leans
towards self-explanatory Lisp code or inline documentation. The
512-line limit isn't just an arbitrary number; it serves as a
discipline to keep the code and its documentation straightforward,
nudging me to strip down complex features to their essentials.

The =custom.el= is an autogenerated configuration layer that's kept
out of version control (it's git-ignored). Since I don't manually edit
or even read this file, it's exempt from the 512-line limit. It serves
as a repository for machine-specific settings and sensitive data, like
the paths to my agenda files or my ERC username.

** Requirements

This configuration uses default-style keybindings and known to work
with GNU Emacs 29.1 and later. If you're using an older version, you
may encounter issues that won't be addressed. Please update your Emacs
to meet this requirement for a smooth experience.

Typically, I roll with environments that have the following set of
tools:

- [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep (=rg=)]]
- [[https://git-scm.com][Git (=git=)]]
- [[https://www.gnupg.org][GnuPG (=gpg=)]]
- [[https://imagemagick.org][Imagemagick (=convert=)]]

So, this config project is kinda built around that fact.
