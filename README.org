* Serghei's GNU Emacs Configuration

This repository holds my personal GNU Emacs setup, which I use daily
and take with me when I switch systems. It's the second thing I clone
after [[https://github.com/sergeyklay/dotfiles][my dotfiles]].

** The Philosophy

This Emacs configuration is like an extension of my memory. It's
designed to be as simple and transparent as possible, reflecting what
I can recall and understand.

You won't find complex settings or intricate designs here. The goal is
to make the configuration easy to read and understand, ensuring I can
mentally keep track of it.

This setup fits what I can keep "in my head" rather than pushing Emacs
to its limits. Simplicity here serves as a mnemonic aid for me.

The configuration is built on four core principles:

- self-contained :: A duo of =early-init.el= and =init.el= files
  responsible for loading and configuring publicly available packages,
  with the exception of ~custom.el~.
- small :: The configuration files collectively stay under 512 lines
  in total.
- built-in packages :: Preference is given to built-in solutions; if
  unavailable, GNU alternatives take precedence over MELPA packages.
- system-agnostic :: The setup should function seamlessly across
  different operating systems.

While the setup focuses on being streamlined, documentation is
necessary for clarity and maintenance. Unlike literate programming, my
approach uses self-explanatory Lisp code or inline comments. The
512-line limit isn't random; it keeps the code and its documentation
straightforward, urging me to simplify complex features.

The =custom.el= file is an autogenerated layer, excluded from version
control (git-ignored). I don't manually edit or read this file, so
it’s exempt from the 512-line limit. It stores machine-specific
settings and sensitive data like paths to my agenda files or my ERC
username.

** Requirements

This configuration uses default-style keybindings and is known to work
with GNU Emacs 29.1 and later. If you use an older version, you may
face issues that won’t be addressed. Please update your Emacs to
ensure smooth functionality.

Typically, I roll with environments that have the following set of
tools:

- [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep (=rg=)]]
- [[https://git-scm.com][Git (=git=)]]
- [[https://www.gnupg.org][GnuPG (=gpg=)]]
- [[https://imagemagick.org][Imagemagick (=convert=)]]

So, this config project is kinda built around that fact.
