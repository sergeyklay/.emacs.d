* Serghei's GNU Emacs Configuration

This repository holds my personal GNU Emacs setup, which I use daily
and take with me when I switch systems. It's the second thing I clone
after [[https://github.com/sergeyklay/dotfiles][my dotfiles]].

** The Philosophy

This Emacs configuration acts as a direct extension of my workflow,
aimed at being as simple and transparent as possible. The setup
reflects what I use and understand, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

The focus is on making the configuration easy to read and
maintain. The goal is for it to remain intuitive, allowing me to keep
track of it without effort.

Rather than pushing Emacs to its limits, this setup stays within a
range that remains practical and easy to manage, serving as an
efficient tool rather than an overengineered solution.

I follow four core principles in this configuration. First, I make
sure everything is self-contained by managing it within the
=early-init.el= and =init.el= files, which handle loading and
configuring publicly available packages. The only exception to this is
=custom.el=. Second, I keep the setup intentionally small, focusing on
clarity and simplicity to ensure the configuration remains concise and
straightforward. Third, I prefer using built-in packages whenever
possible, and if they aren't available, I choose GNU alternatives over
packages from MELPA. Finally, I design the configuration to be
system-agnostic, so it works seamlessly across different operating
systems.

While the setup emphasizes minimalism, clear documentation remains
essential for maintenance. Unlike literate programming, my approach
uses self-explanatory Lisp code or concise inline comments. This keeps
the code and documentation simple, urging continuous refinement.

The =custom.el= file is an autogenerated layer, excluded from version
control. I don't manually edit or read this file, so it doesn't follow
the same principles as the rest of the configuration. It stores
machine-specific settings and sensitive data like paths to agenda
files or ERC usernames.

** Requirements

I stick with the default-style keybindings, avoiding Vim-like
alternatives. Currently, I use GNU Emacs 29.x, and I recommend others
do the same by using this configuration to ensure everything works
smoothly.

Typically, I roll with environments that have the following set of
tools:

- [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep (=rg=)]]
- [[https://git-scm.com][Git (=git=)]]
- [[https://www.gnupg.org][GnuPG (=gpg=)]]
- [[https://imagemagick.org][Imagemagick (=convert=)]]
- [[https://hunspell.github.io/][hunspell (=hunspell=)]]
- [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc (=pandoc=)]]

So, I created this configuration with these tools in mind.

Note: Since I speak, write, and read in three languages — English,
Polish, and Russian — I've configured the spell-checking setup to
support these languages. I've enabled spellckeck by default for
=text-mode= and =latex-mode= using =en_US= dictionary. Thus you might want
to override this configuration to fit your linguistic needs.
