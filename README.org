* Serghei's GNU Emacs Configuration

[[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt][https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL_3-green.svg]]

This repository contains my personal configuration for GNU Emacs that I use on
the daily and port around from system to system with me.  This is the second
repository I clone — after [[https://github.com/sergeyklay/dotfiles][my dotfiles]] — when settling in on a new system.

This configuration uses default-style keybindings and known to work with GNU
Emacs 29.1 and later.
