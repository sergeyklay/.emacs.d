* Serghei's GNU Emacs Configuration

This repository contains my personal GNU Emacs setup, crafted to be an
integral part of my daily workflow and continually tweaked
since 2019. It’s the second repository I clone after [[https://github.com/sergeyklay/dotfiles][my dotfiles]],
ensuring I have a consistent development environment wherever I go.

** The Philosophy

This configuration serves as a practical and flexible tool, designed
to meet my needs without chasing after the latest trends or overly
complex setups. My focus is on providing a straightforward and
transparent configuration, avoiding unnecessary packages or flashy
features. I do not aim to make this setup glamorous; instead, it
remains rooted in functionality and efficiency.

** Core Principles

I adhere to the following guiding principles in this configuration:

- The setup is entirely managed within =early-init.el= and =init.el=,
  which are responsible for loading and configuring publicly available
  packages. The only exception to this is =custom.el=, which is an
  autogenerated layer. I don't manually edit or read this file, so it
  doesn't follow Core Principes as the rest of the configuration.
- This configuration avoids unnecessary complexity, sticking to
  built-in packages whenever possible. When external packages are
  necessary, I prefer GNU alternatives over third-party options from
  MELPA, ensuring that the setup remains streamlined and
  understandable.
- My setup should work seamlessly across different operating systems,
  providing a consistent experience. These days it's somewhat geared
  towards macOS, but it also should work on Linux and I hope Windows.
- The goal is to maintain a setup that is functional and easy to
  manage, without pushing Emacs to its limits or adding features for
  the sake of novelty.
- I intentionally avoid using ~use-package~ because I do not see a clear
  benefit for my use case, and I can manage perfectly well without it.
- I also don't use ~evil-mode~; if I want to work in Vim, I simply use
  Vim.
- I strive to maintain the default Emacs keybindings, and I keep my
  custom keymaps for any desired keybinding ideas, without altering
  default package behavior.

** Requirements

Currently, I use GNU Emacs 29.x, and I recommend others do the same by
using this configuration to ensure everything works smoothly.

I have built this configuration with the following tools in mind:

- [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep (=rg=)]]
- [[https://git-scm.com][Git (=git=)]]
- [[https://www.gnupg.org][GnuPG (=gpg=)]]
- [[https://imagemagick.org][Imagemagick (=convert=)]]
- [[https://www.ghostscript.com/][Ghostscript (=gs=)]]
- [[https://hunspell.github.io/][hunspell (=hunspell=)]]
- [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc (=pandoc=)]]
- [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][The standard Unix password manager (=pass=)]]
- [[https://gnutls.org/][GnuTLS]]

These tools enhance the functionality of my daily workflows, so it's
recommended to have them installed for full compatibility.
