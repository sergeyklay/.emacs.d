This repository contains my personal configuration for GNU Emacs that I use on
the daily and port around from system to system with me.  This is the second
repository I clone — after [[https://github.com/sergeyklay/dotfiles][my dotfiles]] — when settling in on a new system.

This configuration uses default-style keybindings and known to work with GNU
Emacs 27.1 and later.
