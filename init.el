;;; Commentary:

;;   The guiding philosophy behind this Emacs configuration is that it should
;; be a direct extension of my own memory.  This project serves as a
;; representation of what I can actively recall and understand.
;;
;; As a result, you won't find overly complex settings or esoteric designs here.
;; The aim is to keep everything as straightforward and transparent as possible.
;; This ensures that the configuration can be easily read, understood, and held
;; mentally.
;;
;; If you come across this project, bear in mind that it's molded to fit what I
;; can keep "in my head" rather than what Emacs is capable of doing.  The
;; simplicity is intentional and serves as a mnemonic aid for me.
;;
;; I started this project on 4 March 2019 from this commit:
;; eb11ce25b0866508e023db4b8be6cca536cd3044

;;; Code:

;; a proper handler for the file, but during startup, it wonâ€™t need any of them.

;;;; Emacs Server

;; Declare the function `server-running-p' from the "server" module.
;;
;; This declaration informs the Emacs Lisp compiler that the function
;; `server-running-p' exists, but is defined in an external module ("server").
;; This prevents compile-time warnings and helps in generating better bytecode.
;; The `declare-function' acts as a forward declaration, essentially saying:
;; "Trust me, this function will be available at runtime, even if you can't see
;; it now at compile time."
;;
;; Note: This is not a substitute for `(require 'server)` or `(load "server")`,
;; it is only for the compiler's benefit.

;;;; Custom Variables and Faces

;; The `custom-set-variables' and `custom-set-faces' blocks are placed at the
;; end of this file for several reasons:
;;
;; 1. Dependency Handling: Some custom variables might depend on packages that
;; are initialized earlier in this file. Placing the custom blocks at the end
;; ensures all required packages are already loaded.
;;
;; 2. Readability: These blocks are often auto-generated by the Emacs customize
;; interface and can become quite large. Keeping them at the end improves the
;; readability of the config file.
;;
;; 3. Overriding: If there are manual settings scattered through the init file
;; that conflict with custom settings, placing custom blocks at the end allows
;; them to take precedence.
;;
;; If you're an aspiring Emacs hacker, consider these points when deciding
;; where to place your own custom variables and faces.

(custom-set-variables
