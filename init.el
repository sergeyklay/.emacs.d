;;; Commentary:

;;   This file is used to initialize GNU Emacs for my daily needs.
;; I started this project on 4 March 2019 from this commit:
;; eb11ce25b0866508e023db4b8be6cca536cd3044

;;; Code:

;; Begin initialization
(require 'prelude (concat user-emacs-directory "site-lisp/prelude"))

(require 'packaging)    ; Package management stuff and various related settings
(require 'defaults)     ; Sane defaults + settings for which there is no group

;;; init.el ends here
