;; A simple minor-mode to display the point in the status bar.


;;; Code:


;; add point display to mode-line construct
(add-to-list 'mode-line-position
             '(show-point-mode (5 (:eval (format "(%d)" (point)))))
             'append)


(define-minor-mode show-point-mode
  "Toggle show-point mode.
With no argument, this command toggles the mode.
A non-null prefix argument turns the mode on.
A null prefix argument turns it off.

When enabled, the value of `point' is displayed in the
mode-line (after the line and column numbers, if those are being
displayed too).")


(provide 'show-point-mode)
;;; show-point-mode.el ends here
