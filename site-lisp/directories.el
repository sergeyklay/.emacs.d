;; Setting up global variables and directories.

(defconst user-site-lisp-dir (concat user-emacs-directory "site-lisp/")
  "Local site-lisp directory.")

(defconst user-private-dir (concat user-emacs-directory "private/")
  "This is the default place where to store your private configuration layers.
The content of this directory is ignored by Git.")

(defconst user-local-dir (concat user-emacs-directory ".local/")
  "Root directory for local Emacs files.
Use this as permanent storage for files that are safe to share across
systems (if this config is symlinked across several computers).")

(defconst user-etc-dir (concat user-local-dir "etc/")
  "Directory for non-volatile storage.
Use this for files that don't change much, like servers binaries,
external dependencies or long-term shared data.")

(defconst user-cache-dir (concat user-local-dir "cache/")
  "Directory for volatile storage.
Use this for files that change often, like cache files.")

(defconst user-host-dir (concat user-etc-dir "hosts/" (system-name) "/")
  "The directory with user-specific Emacs settings.")
